# Tests in this repository

This repository currently has no dedicated Xcode unit-test target. The tests in this folder are **pending integration**.

`Tests/Security/PathSafetyTests.swift` contains XCTest cases for safe config-name validation and config-path containment logic. To enable these tests in Xcode:

1. Add a new macOS Unit Testing Bundle target (e.g. `ClashXTests`).
2. Add `Tests/Security/PathSafetyTests.swift` to that target.
3. Set `@testable import ClashX` for the test target.
4. Run the tests with `xcodebuild test`.

Notes:
- A robust symlink-escape integration test should run on macOS with a writable filesystem sandbox representative of app behavior.
- `PathSafetyTests` currently focuses on deterministic name validation/path APIs and config replacement invariants.
- Manual helper validation case to add during macOS test runs: `http://127.evil.com/proxy.pac` must be rejected by helper PAC validation.
