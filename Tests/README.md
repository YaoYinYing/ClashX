# Tests in this repository

This repository currently has no dedicated Xcode unit-test target.

`Tests/Security/PathSafetyTests.swift` contains XCTest cases for safe config-name validation and config-path containment logic. To enable these tests in Xcode:

1. Add a new macOS Unit Testing Bundle target (e.g. `ClashXTests`).
2. Add `Tests/Security/PathSafetyTests.swift` to that target.
3. Set `@testable import ClashX` for the test target.
4. Run the tests with `xcodebuild test`.
